All the code here are intended for public.
Feel free to copy and re-use the code. These codes are strictly for educational purposes only.

These codes are written along with my self-taught R journey. So code might not be that efficient. I might revisit them someday.
Most of the codes here are DSE specific. I only write codes to solve a problem that I am facing but not yet solved by others.

I might rewrite them in python in the future. But for now, it is R only.
